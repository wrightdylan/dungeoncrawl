# Dungeon Crawler

This was just a little game I wrote in 2021 when learning Rust :crab:. This was the final result from following the book 'Hands-on Rust' by Herbert WOlverson. This was originally done in Rust 1.68 and completed by 1.70. I have only now decided to upload it, with a quite update to Rust 1.75.
